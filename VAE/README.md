# Deep Learning with Beta-Variational Autoencoders

This repository delves into the exploration of Beta-Variational Autoencoders (Beta-VAE), a variant of VAEs that introduces an adjustable hyperparameter, beta, to balance the trade-off between the latent channel capacity and independence constraints. It is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of Beta-VAE's architecture and its applications in deep learning.

## Overview

The "Beta-VAE" notebook investigates the following key concepts:
- **Understanding Beta-VAE:** Introduction to the Beta-VAE architecture, including its significance and how it extends the standard VAE framework.
- **The Reparameterization Trick:** A closer look at how Beta-VAE implements the reparameterization trick to allow backpropagation through random nodes.
- **Effect of Varying Beta:** Experiments demonstrating the impact of the beta hyperparameter on the model's learning dynamics and latent space disentanglement.
- **Interpolation in Z Latent Space:** Techniques to visualize and interpret the continuous latent space by interpolating between latent variables.
- **Plotting Loss Curves:** Detailed analysis of the training process through loss curves for both the encoder and decoder, providing insights into model convergence.
- **Application Examples:** Utilizing Beta-VAE for tasks such as anomaly detection, data generation, and more, showcasing its versatility.

## Installation
